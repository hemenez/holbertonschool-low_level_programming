# 0x09. C - argc, argv

## Synopsis
This project covers:

* How to use arguments passed to your program
* What are two prototypes of `main` that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
* How to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

## Requirements for C files
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All files must be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* C programs and functions must be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags `-Wall` `-Werror` `-Wextra` and `-pedantic`
* All of our files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* No more than 5 functions per file
* Use Holberton's version of [_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
* All our header files should be guarded
* Not allowed to use global variables
* Not allowed to use the standard use (functions ike `printf`, `puts`, etc.

## Environment
The project was tested and compiled on `Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty64)` via Vagrant run through VirtualBox.

## File Descriptions
This repository contains the following files. Listed are the parameters of each task:

### 0-whatsmyname.c

Write a program that prints its name, followed by a new line.

* If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again
* You should not remove the path before the name of the program

### 1-args.c

Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.

* Your program should print a number, followed by a new line

### 2-args.c

Write a program that prints all arguments it receives.

* All arguments should be printed, including the first one
* Only print one argument per line, ending with a new line

### 3-mul.c

Write a program that multiplies two numbers.

* Your program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line
* You can assume that the two numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer
* If the program does not receive two arguments, your program should print `Error` followed by a new line, returning `1`

### 4-add.c

Write a program that adds positive numbers.

* Print the result, followed by a new line
* If no number is passed to the program, print `0`, followed by a new line
* If one of the number contains symbols that are not digits, print `Error`, followed by a new line, and return `1`
* You can assume that numbers and the addition of all the numbers can be stored in an `int`
